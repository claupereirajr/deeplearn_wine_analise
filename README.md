# Deep Learning Python

**Abstract:** Two datasets are included, related to red and white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal. The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests (see [Cortez et al., 2009], [UCI - Wine Quality Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/) ).

The data consists of two datasets that are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese “Vinho Verde” wine.
